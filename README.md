### A little background

During my 5+ year stint as a Product Manager, I was always jealous of the developers. They didn't just _talk_ about new products and features, they _built_ them! 

As I gained more clout as a PM, I was asked to step away from the dev team & technical strategy so I could focus on the long-term product vision. This was not what I wanted. 

I wanted to strategize on implementation architecture. I wanted to problem solve. So I took a step back from my product career in 2022 to learn to code.
